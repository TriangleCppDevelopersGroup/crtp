Curiously Recurring Template Pattern demo

This collection of files is from a presentation on the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern presented to the Triangle C++ Developers 
Group on 11/07/2017. Each header is an example of how it can be used. Just enough code was written to instantiate classes to demonstrate
there are no real compile issues.

The PowerPoint includes the slides to give context of the discussion.
